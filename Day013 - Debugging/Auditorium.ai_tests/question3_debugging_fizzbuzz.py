# No shortcuts - don't copy-paste to replace the code entirely with a working solution.
# The code needs to print the solution to the FizzBuzz game.
#
# Your program should print each number from 1 to x where x is the input number.
#
# However when the number is divisible by 3 then instead of printing the number it should print "Fizz".
#
# When the number is divisible by 5, then instead of printing the number it should print "Buzz".
#
# And if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 e.g. 15 then instead of the number it should print "FizzBuzz".
#
# Hint
# There is more than one fix required.

# target = int(input())
# for number in range(1, target + 1):
#   if number % 3 == 0 or number % 5 == 0:
#     print("FizzBuzz")
#   if number % 3 == 0:
#     print("Fizz")
#   if number % 5 == 0:
#     print("Buzz")
#   else:
#     print([number])


target = int(input("What number do you wish to go up to? "))
for number in range(1, target + 1):
    if number % 3 == 0 and number % 5 == 0:
        print("FizzBuzz")
    elif number % 3 == 0:
        print("Fizz")
    elif number % 5 == 0:
        print("Buzz")
    else:
        print(number)


# The fix for this code was to change line 33 to use 'and' rather than 'or' and change the if's in line 35 and 37 to
# elif. The last fix was to remove the square brackets in line 40.
