# #Print is Your Friend
# pages = 0
# word_per_page = 0
# pages = int(input("Number of pages: "))
# word_per_page == int(input("Number of words per page: "))
# total_words = pages * word_per_page
# print(total_words)

# When printing word_per_page, I get the output as 0. Looking at the code for that variable, I can see a double equals
# operator rather than an assignment operator.

# Fixed code:

pages = 0
word_per_page = 0
pages = int(input("Number of pages: "))
word_per_page = int(input("Number of words per page: "))
total_words = pages * word_per_page
print(total_words)
