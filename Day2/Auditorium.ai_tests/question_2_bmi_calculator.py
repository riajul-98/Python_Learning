# BMI Wikipedia Page
#
# The BMI is a measure of someone's weight taking into account their height. e.g. If a tall person and a short person
# both weigh the same amount, the short person is usually more overweight.
#
# The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m):
# BMI = weight (kg) / height^2 (m^2)
#
# NOTE: You should convert the bmi to a whole number and print out a whole number in order to pass all the tests.

# 1st input: enter height in meters e.g: 1.65
height = input("Please enter your height in meters: ")
# 2nd input: enter weight in kilograms e.g: 72
weight = input("Please enter your weight in kilograms: ")
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

# Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡

bmi = int(float(weight) / float(height)**2)

print("Your BMI is " + str(bmi))
