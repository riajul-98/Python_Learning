# Project 1: Band Name Generator. This application allows people to generate a band name by asking them the city
# they grew up in and the name of their pet. The name will then be the city name + pet name.

#1. Create a greeting for your program.

print("Welcome to the band name generator")

#2. Ask the user for the city that they grew up in.

print("Please enter the city you grew up in:")
city_name = input()

#3. Ask the user for the name of their pet.

print("Please enter the name of your pet:")
pet_name = input()

#4. Combine the name of their city and pet and show them their band name.

print("Your band name is: " + city_name + " " + pet_name)

#5. Make sure the input cursor shows on a new line
