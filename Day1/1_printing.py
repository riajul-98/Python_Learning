# Printing to the console in Python

print("Hello World!")

# The print function tells the computer to output a string or whatever is in the brackets
# "Hello World!" is a string as it is enclosed in quotations
# You can use double quotes or single quotes but the text in the string should not contain the same type of quotes as
# the computer may think it is the end of the string. You can use the escape backslash (\) or use the other type of
# quotes.
# e.g.
# print("She said: 'Hello' and then left")
# or
# print('She said: "Hello" and then left')
# or
# print("She said: \"Hello\" and then left")
