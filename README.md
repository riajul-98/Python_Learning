# Python Learning
A repository of Python projects worked on whilst undertaking Angela Yu's 100 Days of Code

## Introduction
This repository showcases projects which I have worked on whilst going through 100 Days of Code by Angela Yu. The course runs through essential Python material from beginner to expert and the topic names will be displayed in the folder names. A portion of the course is done using Repl.it but has been copied to Pycharm for the purposes of adding the code to this git repository. Due to this, some lines of code may not work such as when the replit clear function is used.

The course also uses resources such as Auditorium.ai to test the learner and I have copied and pasted the code taken from there as well as my solutions. I have added the instructions which we are given as comments.

This course is still in progress and hence, due to work / interviews, there may be some days / weeks where there are no new code added but rest assured, this course is still being worked through.

## Projects
Throughout the course, there are a handful of projects involved. These include but are not limited to:
 - **BlackJack**
 - **Number Guessing Game**
 - **FizzBuzz**
 - **Pong**
 - **Flash Card App**
 - **Building an API** 
 - **Amazon Price Tracker**
 - **Professional Portfolio**

## Installation and Setup
