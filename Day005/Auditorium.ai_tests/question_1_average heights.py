# Instructions
# You are going to write a program that calculates the average student height from a List of heights.
#
# e.g. student_heights = [180, 124, 165, 173, 189, 169, 146]
#
# The average height can be calculated by adding all the heights together and dividing by the total number of heights.
#
# e.g.
#
# 180 + 124 + 165 + 173 + 189 + 169 + 146 = 1146
#
# There are a total of 7 heights in student_heights
#
# 1146 Ã· 7 = 163.71428571428572
#
# Average height rounded to the nearest whole number = 164
#
# Important You should not use the sum() or len() functions in your answer. You should try to replicate their
# functionality using what you have learnt about for loops.

# Input a Python list of student heights
student_heights = input().split()
for n in range(0, len(student_heights)):
    student_heights[n] = int(student_heights[n])
# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code above ğŸ‘†

# Write your code below this row ğŸ‘‡

import math

number_of_students = 0
sum_of_heights = 0

for height in student_heights:
    sum_of_heights += height
    number_of_students += 1

print("total height = " + str(sum_of_heights))
print("number of students = " + str(number_of_students))
average_height = round(sum_of_heights / number_of_students)

print("average height = " + str(average_height))
