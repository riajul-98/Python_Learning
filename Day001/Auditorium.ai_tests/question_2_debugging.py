# print(Day 1 - String Manipulation")
# print("String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.")
#   print('e.g. print("Hello " + "world")')
# print(("New lines can be created with a backslash and n.")

print("Day 1 - String Manipulation") # Missing double quote at the start
print("String Concatenation is done with the \"+\" sign.") # Double quotes around the + caused the computer to stop
# the string input before the +.
print('e.g. print("Hello " + "world")') # Indentation error
print("New lines can be created with a backslash and n.") # Extra parenthesis before the string.
